Java EE 6 Web Profile with Continuous Deployment and Sauce support
-----

This ClickStart is a full Java EE 6 Web Profile application, with a database and continuous deployment.  It also
demonstrates how to run Selenium tests against the Clickstart using [Sauce](http://saucelabs.com)
Launch this ClickStart and it will generate a database, app, source repo and build service for you. 

This is an example of the jboss container in action. It showcases JPA and persistence configuration EE 6 style and how to setup an app that uses persistence.xml with a CloudBees database. To make changes, clone your generated repo. 
Any changes you then push will be build and deployed.
